# Coding Challenge Day 1

### In this John Smilga tutorial, you will learn how to create a counter and write conditions that change the color based on positive or negative numbers displayed.

### This project will give you more practice working with the DOM and you can use this simple counter in other projects like a pomodoro clock.

```
document.querySelectorAll()
forEach()
addEventListener()
currentTarget property
classList
textContent
```
